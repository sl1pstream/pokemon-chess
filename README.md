# Pokemon Chess

An AI-made chess game with Pokemon-themed pieces and sprites. **All code has been generated, revised, compacted, etc. with Claude Sonnet 4 via Amazon Q in VSCode.**

**This game requires an internet connection to connect to Pokemon API.**

I took the idea from ["I tested the new GPT 5!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFLDvOFLW0&t=615s&pp=ygUTbXJ3aG9zdGhlYm9zcyBncHQgNQ%3D%3D) by Mrwhosetheboss

**To anyone trying this out, if you run into any gameplay issues or glitches, please open an issue!** I have tested this a lot before publishing but there may still be glitches I am unaware of

Code is unoptimized and will remain that way for the forseeable future
